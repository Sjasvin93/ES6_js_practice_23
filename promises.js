//-----Promises-----
// Properties
/* 
1. A Promise is a JavaScript object that links "Producing Code" and "Consuming Code".
2. "Producing Code" can take some time and "Consuming Code" must wait for the result.
3. A JavaScript Promise object can be:
   -> Pending
   -> Fulfilled
   -> Rejected
4. The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.
5. While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
6. When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
7. When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
